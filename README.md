# Chrono Ark Mods

A list of various mods for Chrono Ark. Requires BepInEx.

The .dll files are the mod files. I included .cs source code for people who want to look at it.

# [505Error Skill Randomizer]

This is Chrono Ark but 505Error taken to the extreme.

Level Up: The effects of 505Error are activated by default. However, the first 3 skills are gone meaning you choose between 3 random skills from all investigators.

Skill Book, Infinite Skill Book: Scrambled to show random Investigator skills. 

Golden Skill Book: Shows you random Investigator Rare Skills.

Extra settings

Chaos Mode: Include every existing skill in the game (such as enemy skills and item effects) into the selection pool. Gets silly quickly. (Default OFF)

Healing 101: Gives 2 Healing 101 at the start of the game to help support characters pick up heal skills. (Default OFF) 

(Go to BepInEx -> config -> open in Notepad: org.windy.chronoark.cardmod.randomskillmod.cfg)

# [Fox Orb Genderlock Removal]

Fox Orb can be used on male characters.


# [Parry Skill Book]

You can obtain parrying attack skillbook from Lian even after unlocking her. It costs 0 credits. 

(Optional) The game text will say that it still requires 8 credits. To fix this: Chrono Ark > ChronoArk_Data > StreamingAssets > LangDialogueDB.csv: Ctrl+F "8 credits", delete the parenthesis

Default 8 characters. To change the number,
